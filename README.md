Overbrook Construction INC. is a premiere home building company based out of Bellevue, WA. Until May 2016, the existing website was a static HTML/CSS multi-page site, that only had text regarding who the company was and what they did.

As of June 2016, the website at OverbrookConstructionInc.com was transformed into a full-stack web application that not only gives context to the user about the company background, but also features a Google Map interface with the ability to filter through three options of what points are shown. Overbrook Construction Inc. is planning on continuing to build homes throughout 2017 and on, so the user can choose to view Completed, Under Construction, or Future Sites. 

The contents of the map directly link to the respective projects on the Gallery page, where users are able to view additional photos and read details about each home.

The contact page feautures an email form so users can send email inqueries directly to the company, without having to go to other pages.

The technologies used to build this site are:
JavaScript
- Node
- Angular
- Express
MLabs (Cloud based Mongo Database)
AWS
-S3 (a bucket to store imagery)
Google Maps API

Also built into the site is a Content Management System (CMS), where admin users can login and do basic CRUD operations for the homes that are displayed on the site. Furthermore, there is an image file uploader that places each uploaded photo into the existing AWS S3 bucket.
